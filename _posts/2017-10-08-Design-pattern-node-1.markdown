**Design Pattern is actual solutions used in industrial software.** Over the years, developers have experimented with variety design solutions, and Desigh Pattern is a set of solutions that often create the best outcome. Each Design pattern has created for a particular purpose. The scope of application is as important as the solution itself.

**Design Pattern is more about concepts than coding templates.** It is a guideline to make the code more reusable and to prevent mistakes.

**Design Pattern make communicate effctively and prevent misunderstanding.** Design Pattern give a name for each pattern, so developers do not have to repeat all the details in communication. Prior knowledge of particular pattern not only give info about the solution, it also describes the original problem. Knowledge of design patterns leaves less room for misunderstanding. 

All the material I went through is written in Java, only because that I am more familiar with Java. Design Pattern applies to all object-oriented language. However, Design Pattern is essential to Java learning. Many Java frameworks are built upon Design Pattern, therefore the knowledge of Design Patten will help understand the document of Java framework like Spring.

### Factory Pattern

Factory class create objects like real factory create products, there are different categories and products can send to different stores.

### Composite Pattern

Composite Pattern helps create a tree-sharp structure, which consists of instances of composite class, each works as a tree node.

I read the tutorials form [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/) and [journaldev.com](https://www.journaldev.com/1827/java-design-patterns-example-tutorial), then I watched the vedios from [Design Patterns
by University of Alberta](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns/home/welcome).
