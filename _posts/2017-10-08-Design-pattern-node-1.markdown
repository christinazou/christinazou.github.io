description: a note for Design Pattern. I found several reading materials on the web and a course on Coursera. Here is what I learned. # Add post description (optional)

Design pattern is more like ideas than coding templates.

I read the tutorials form [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/) and [journaldev.com](https://www.journaldev.com/1827/java-design-patterns-example-tutorial), then I watched the vedios from [Design Patterns
by University of Alberta](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns/home/welcome).

All the material I listed here is written in Java only because I am more familiar with Java. Design Pattern applies to all object-oriented language. However, Design Pattern is essential to Java learning. Many Java frameworks are built upon Design Pattern, therefore the knowledge of Design Patten will help understand the document of Java framework like Spring.
